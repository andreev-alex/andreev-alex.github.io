I created large-scale fintech products with an active audience of 250 000 to 73 000 000 users. I am a driven designer with 4+ years of experience developing mobile and web products for a broad audience from scratch: I prefer to take ownership in the developing process as an individual contributor and work towards the result. I have strong skills in creating design systems, user research, and web development.

Primarily work in the fin-tech and ed-tech areas, but I can also dive into others.

I am considering different work formats: remote work from other countries, office or hybrid (visa sponsorship and relocation required).
