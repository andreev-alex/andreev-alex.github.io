            <blockquote>Albert Sayapov
               Expert in IT Infrastructure & Digital Transformation at Qatar Insurance
               I had the privilege of working closely with Alex Andreev at Qatar Insurance Group. Alex initially served as a Senior Product Designer and later as the Lead Product Designer. His contributions were instrumental to the success of our major growth projects, notably the QIC-Connect Design System, Managing Insurance Policy Interface, and Qatar Insurance Journal (QIC Reads).
               Alex designed the web version of the policy management interface, allowing clients to manage their policies online. This design reduced queues by 50% and accelerated application processing by 30%, leading to increased company profits and a successful transition into the digital space.
               Additionally, Alex played a crucial role in designing a media platform focused on life in Qatar. He developed a User Interface and employed a link-building strategy that resulted in a 25% increase in organic traffic and a reduction in the bounce rate to below 40%, directly contributing to the growth of insurance sales on the qic.online website.
               Alex also spearheaded the development and implementation of the QIC-Connect Design System in Figma, ensuring consistent user experience and interface design for over 1.1 million Qatar Insurance clients. His approach accelerated development by 35%, improved product quality, and reduced task completion time by 20%.
               Alex's unique ability to blend usability in user interface design with visually appealing UI made him a valuable team member. His attention to detail, sense of responsibility, and results-oriented mindset make me highly recommend him for any future product design opportunities.
