         <h1>QIC Connect: A Unified Web Design System</h1>
         <img src="/img/highlights/img-gradient-1.png" alt="">
         <p>To support Qatar Insurance Group’s digital transformation and transition into InsurTech, I led the creation of QIC Connect, a comprehensive web design system. Designed to unify and streamline the development of QIC’s digital products across Qatar and the UAE, QIC Connect ensures consistency in user experience, visual design, and functionality while accelerating product development timelines.</p>
